phpProject

This is intended to be a tutorial/demo of my work using php.
As a side-effect, I am practicing the use of Github as well.
It is based on
Create a Content Management System With PHP and MySQLI Part-1
http://www.w3programmers.com/create-a-content-management-system-with-php-oop-and-mysqli-part-1/

1. Start with an html template
2. Turn this to be useable forCMS
3. Step 1: convert index.html to index.php
4. Separate the menu, header, content, left bar and footer into separate .php extensions.

NB. I will not be using Dreamweaver but will be coding by hand using Komodo Edit.
